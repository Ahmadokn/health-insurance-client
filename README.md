## Project Description

This repository contains the **front-end** (client) side of our Health Insurance Risk Calculator. The client is a static website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, which allows an insurance agent to input customer data (age, height, weight, blood pressure category, family history) and view a final risk score and category. All calculations are performed on the server; the client merely collects the inputs and displays the results returned from the API.

### Features

- **Responsive UI** for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Validation** for input fields (e.g., minimum height, positive age/weight).
- **Family Disease** checkboxes allowing multiple selections.
- **Risk Category** displayed clearly based on the server response.

### Technology Stack

- **HTML5 / CSS3** for structure and styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for form handling and API calls
- (Optional) Basic styling with Flexbox or external frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository** (the client):
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmadokn/health-insurance-client.git
